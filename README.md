# gene-prediction-pipeline
This project focuses on improving the gene annotation of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99, a major fungal pathogen, using the BRAKER3 pipeline. By integrating RNA-seq evidence with ab initio predictions, we generated an updated gene model and compared it against the existing annotation from FungiDB.
